    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The spellcheck attribute has been available to web authors since February 2009 (<a href="https://blog.whatwg.org/the-road-to-html-5-spellchecking#examples">Pilgrim, 2009<a/>). It is new to the HTML5 standards and works with specific elements.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_spellcheck.asp">W3Schools</a> website, several browsers support this attribute such as “Firefox 2.0, Safari 5.1 and Opera 10.5, Microsoft Edge 10.0 and Google Chrome 9.0."</p>

<p> This attribute is known as a Global attribute because it specifies whether an element has its spelling and grammar checked. Some elements, like the &ltp&gt or the paragraph tag, can be paired with the contenteditable and the spellcheck attribute. The following is an example: &ltp contenteditable="true” spellcheck=”true”&gtcontent added/p&gt. For the attribute to work with the browser, its value equals either “true” (spelling and grammar will be checked) or “false” (spelling and grammar won’t be checked).</p>

<h2>How the Spellcheck Attribute Works</h2>

<p><img src="Image/SpellCheckDemo350px.png" alt="Spell Check Code" class="align-right medium"/>The spellcheck attribute tells the browser to check or not to check for spelling. Browsers “read” the text and compare it to a dictionary database. Safari offers suggestions for misspelled words “when the attribute is included and set to “true”” (Wufoo, n.d. para. 2). The Wufoo website explains how browsers differ when the spellcheck attribute is present and set to the value of “true.” Some browsers, like IE10, Chrome, and Opera check the word once it is typed and the punctuation or space has been added after the word (Wufoo, n.d.). In Firefox, if the onblur element (used in forms to inform the input field when the user leaves the input box) is used with the spellcheck attribute set to the value of “true,” “Firefox spell checks the rest of the document” including “elements that are by default spell checked” (Wufoo, n.d.).

<h2>History of Proofreading</h2>

<p>The art of writing well, with meticulous attention paid to recording records of rulers and merchants, meant that the writer had to proofread their work. The exact point in history when proofreading for content, context, spelling, and grammar began, probably dovetailed with the development of the written language.</p>

   <p>The Chinese are credited with discovering printing “by the end of the 2nd century C.E.” (Encyclopaedia Britannica, History of Printing, para, 1). As printing developed from carved wood blocks, as early as 764–770 in Japan, to the first movable type created from a mixture of clay and glue by the “Chinese alchemist named Pi Sheng” around 1041–48, the time and effort needed to print would make proofreading mandatory (Encyclopeadia Britannica, “History of Printing”, para. 4 and 5).</p>

<p>The first mention of proofreading was discovered in a contract dating back to 1499. This contract “held the author finally responsible for correction of proofs” (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018, “proofreading”, para. 1). Today, writers have the luxury of using spellchecking programs that are included with their writing software. Yet the tried and true manual editing methods are needed because the spellchecking functions don’t catch every spelling or grammar error.

<h2>Spellchecking Programs</h2>

<p>The first computer spell checker program began its development around 1957 by Les Earnest of Stanford University (Sertiadi, 2014, p. 1).  By 1971, “Les Earnest and Ralph Gorin creates the first spell checker program, which displays corrected alternatives of misspelled word that differed by one letter and small transpositions” (Patel, 2014, p. 9). These programs have progressed from merely underlining misspelled words to giving possible suggestions and autocorrecting while users type. Many digital devices support or feature spell checking functions. </p>
<p>Hass (1999) researched old and new technologies with case studies to show how these technologies are incorporated and used in people’s lives. She quoted Bijker (1995) stating “technological development and change is best understood as multidimensional , and multifaceted—a web that is built in fits and starts, and cannot be properly understood in hindsight” (as cited in Hass 1999, p. 221).
In the case of spellchecking, the “fits and starts” may be related to their reliability. Today, spell checkers are used as a first edit because they lack accuracy. Until they’re developed to catch many more spelling or grammar mistakes and distinguish between homophones through context, they may never substitute for skilled human copy or technical editors. At present, people rely on a combination of computer spell checking, and human editing.

   <h2>A Brief History of the Spellcheck Attribute</h2>
    <p>According to Pilgrim (2009) the adoption of the spellcheck attribute had been debated for some time. Developers liked the idea of turning on or turning off the browser's spellcheck funcion on a given field. Work on the spellcheck attribute began in earnest around 2006.
      <ul class="list">
        <li>-Brett Wilson thinks of a potential algorithm using the accept attribute to trigger spellchecking.</li>

        <li>-Ian Hicks mentions using &lt;input type="text" accept=""&gt</li>
      </ul>
        <h4>2008</h4>
        <ul class="list">
        <li>-No interest except for Google and Opera</li>
      </ul>
        <h4>2009</h4>
          <ul class="list">
        <li>-Spellcheck attribute adopted in February, 2009</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Pilgrim (2009) explained that the attribute didn't find widespread support. A WebKit is a software that draws text on a screen and checks spelling and grammar. Maciej Stachowiak (Apple) didn't understand why someone would turn this function off for "paricular form controls or editable HTML areas" (Pilgrim, 2009). Since interest did exist, the spellcheck attribute was adopted.</p>

<h2>Consequences of Relying on Spellchecking Programs</h2>
<p>Teachers concerned that students rely too heavily on the spell check functions, worry that students won’t develop the reading, writing, and speaking skills necessary to function in society. On the other hand, sometimes these programs can help people with Dyslexia ( Nordquist, 2017). “Psychologists have found that when we work with computers, we often fall victim to two cognitive ailments—complacency and bias—that can undercut our performance and lead to mistakes” (Carr, 2013, para. 11).  Will our reliance on automated spell checking improve our writing abilities or decrease them over time?</p>
